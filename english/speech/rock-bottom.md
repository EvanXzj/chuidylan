# Rock Bottom

**The thing about life is it's not always easy, and you can't always win. Some point of your life, it hits you. It hits you really really hard.** 

生活的真相就是，生活很难，你不可能一直是赢家。有时候，生活会打击你，非非常非常沉重的打击。

**The person you love doesn't love you back, you get fired, you lose a family member. At some point of your life, you're gonna hit rock bottom.** 

你爱的人不爱你，你被辞退了，你失去了亲人。有时候，你会跌入低谷。 

**You're paralyzed, you're like, "Why?" And that why can really really destroy you. Once you start asking yourself, "Why me? Why not the others, why me?** 

你已经麻木了，你会问为什么。“为什么”会摧毁你。一旦你开始问你自己，“为什么是我？为什么不是别人？为什么是我？

**I'm actually a good person, I never did something significantly bad, why the hell did it hit me?" Because that's life. Life is unfair.** 


我真的是个好人，我从来没有做过严重的坏事，但为什么偏偏是我遇到这么多坎坷？”因为，这就是生活，生活就是不公平的。

**Success is not measured on the days when the sun shines. Success is measured on the dark, stormy, cloudy days. And if you can't absorb failure, you're never gonna meet success.** 

成功不是用阳光灿烂的日子来衡量的，成功是由那些黑暗的、狂风暴雨的、阴云蔽日的日子来衡量的。如果你无法接受失败，你就永远不会成功。

**Sometimes it takes things falling apart, for better things to fall into place. Sometimes it takes the most uncomfrotable path, to lead your life to the most beautiful place.** 

有时它会让事情分崩离析，让更好的事情发生（不破不立）。有时候，要走最不起眼的路，才能把你的生活引向最美丽的地方。

 **There`s gonna be bad days , theres gonna be dark days, but you`ve gotta embrace it, Because that pain is what makes you stronger. Failure is what makes you stronger.** 

会有不好的日子，会有黑暗的日子，但你必须拥抱它，因为痛苦会让你更坚强。失败使你更坚强。

 **You have to accept those down times, because once you realize those down times, are just as much part of life as anything else, you`re able to  strive again.**

你必须接受那些低潮时期，因为一旦你意识到那些低潮时期和其他任何事情一样是生活的一部分，你就能够再次奋斗。

**You`ll never see the purpose of the storm, until you see the growth it produced. You`ll never understand why you went through what you went through, until you see the strength, the power, the resilience that it built inside of you .**

直到你看到暴风雨形成你才明白他的目的。你永远不会明白你为什么要经历你所经历的一切，直到你在内心建立起毅力、力量和韧性，你才能明白你为什么你要经历你所经历的一切。

**Ask yourself why. But this why is a better why, “why am i doing this ?  why am i failing?Why am i even getting myself in a situation where i could fail? Because i have a dream.Because i have goals.”** 

问问你自己为什么。但这就是为什么“我为什么要这么做？为什么我会失败？为什么我会让自己陷入失败的境地？因为我有一个梦想。因为我有目标。”

 

**And the more you`re thinking back to those original goals, the easier it is for you to get back up and say, **“Alright”**, it might be difficult, it might be painful , it might be stressful, there might be no people that believe in me, but i believe in myself.**

你越是想回到最初的目标，你就越容易站起来说“好吧”，这可能是困难的，可能是痛苦的，可能是压力的，可能没有人相信我，但我相信我自己。

**You know it might have been the case, that you should have gone through that harsh, break up, that you should have gone through that heavy loss, just in order to find something even better, but the only way to get to that even better, is to get back up and work.** 

你知道可能是这样的，你应该经历那种严酷的，粉碎的，你应该经历那种沉重的损失，只是为了找到更好的东西，但唯一能找到更好东西的方法——就是重新站起来努力奋斗。

**To get back up and put yourself out there again, And arise from that again, stronger , better, smarter,  ready to grasp that new opportunity.** 

重新振作起来！重新振作起来！重新振作起来！变得更坚强，更好，更聪明，准备抓住新的机遇。

**You gotta believe the tables in your life will turn, that pain will become power,  that weakness will become strength, and that confusion will become peace, better things are coming for your life.**

你要相信你生命中的桌子会转动，痛苦会变成力量，软弱会变成坚强，混乱会变成和谐，更好的事情会降临到你的生命中。

**Everyday is a new beginning. It`s time for you to start treating it that way.** 

每一天都是新的一天，该是时候认真对待它了。
