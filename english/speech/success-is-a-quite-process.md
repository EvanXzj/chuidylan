# Success is a quiet process

As Ellen Cook puts it, success is like a quiet daily set of tasks. Real real small. It's like that quiet walk to the library, that empty 24/7 library late at night, over and over and over. Or as I sit there studying other great people and I compare their actions with my own actions over and over and over. Or as I sit doing 30 minutes of meditation a day over and over and over. Making the choice to eat foods that enhance my brain neuro-transmitters over and over and over. 

正如Ellen Cook所言，成功就像每日默默完成的任务。这些任务很小，比如每天晚上都自己走去那个空荡荡的24小时图书馆，或者我反复地研究其他优秀的人，并把他们的行为和我的进行对比，或者我每天都用30分钟练习冥想，或者我一直坚持吃健康的、有益于我的大脑神经递质的食物。

It's a very quiet process where you're doing these simple little tasks but finding love in those simple little tasks. It's not the big thing where you do this one thing and something big happens. Being able to make a success out of your life. It's not purely down to luck. You have more control over it than you think. You can decide to be successful. You can decide to have the fast cars and the big house. 

这个过程很安静，你的任务很简单也很小，但是你逐渐喜欢上它们。它们不是什么伟大的事情，不是那种影响深远的事情。在人生中，获得成功并不全靠运气。你对生活的掌控力，比你想象的要强。你可以决定自己是否成功，是否能够拥有豪车和大房子。

And it starts right here with your studying, not because getting good grades is going to bring you success in the future, it's about the work ethic and the attitude you have towards your studying that will transfer to your work after you graduate. It's about believing that you can achieve something and doing whatever it takes to achieve it. It's about fine-tuning the skills you have to zero in on your goals, the skills that you are improving while you're studying. 

这一切都是从现在开始的，从你目前的学习开始，这不是因为好成绩能让你在未来取得成功，而是因为你对学习这件事的职业精神和态度。在你毕业之后，它们仍然能够影响你。这也是因为，你相信自己能够实现梦想，并且用尽全力为之奋斗。这更是因为，你不断打磨自己的技能，从头学起，通过学习来不断提高它们。

Work ethic, time management, reading, critical thinking, problem solving, decision making, focus, reasoning, persuasion, organization, overcoming obstacles, and self-motivation. These are all skills that all great students have improved and refined over years of efficient and effective studying. And it's these students that have made a decision that when the world is saying that's impossible, you're not capable, your dreams will stay as dreams. 

职业精神，时间管理，阅读，批判性思维，解决问题的能力，做决定的能力，专注力，推理能力，口才，组织能力，克服困难的能力，自己给的动力，这些都是优秀的学生们在多年的高效学习中提高的能力。在全世界都跟他们说不可能、说他们做不到、说他们无法实现梦想的时候，他们能够做出自己的决定。

They have that lone voice that goes, no, you know what, it is possible, just watch me. They have gone through this process of growth, and they have pushed and pushed through all the obstacles that were thrown at them. It's important that you don't think of your studying as though it's all about passing your exams and getting a piece of paper at the end of it all so you can get a good job, because it's so much more than that.

在他们心中，有一个声音响起。不！一切皆有可能！走着瞧吧！他们经历了成长的过程，无论遇到什么样的困难，他们都能一一克服。你不要认为学习就是为了通过考试、拿到文凭、得到好工作。这一点很重要，因为学习的意义远不止于此。

And it's the great students that understand this. It's not about your exams. It's about the process and the journey you go on and the skills you refine over the years. It's about when you don't feel like studying but you continue to push through and study anyway. It's doing the things that you need to do, that you know you need to do when you don't feel like doing it, because the reality is, is that most people can study when they're feeling good. 

优秀的学生，才会明白这个道理。学习不是为了考试，学习的意义在于它的过程本身，在于你这些年来练就的技能。学习就是在你不想学的时候，还能督促自己去学习。学习就是要去做那些你需要做却不想做的事情。因为，实际上，对于大多数人来说，在自己状态好的时候学习不是什么难事。

Most people can study when they have no distractions, when they're in a quiet environment, when there's pressure put on them as a deadline is approaching. But just being able to study on the highs isn't good enough. You have to be able to study all the time. So learning how to refocus your mind on the lows and knowing the lows are going to end is a huge skill. The process is just as important as the actual prize, because the process is going to make you. The deeper the process, the greater the reward. Just remember the prize is going to be huge. 

在没有令自己分心的事情时，在环境很安静时，在没有截止日期逼近的压力时，大多数人都能学习。但是，在高峰时期学习，这还不够。你要做到在任何时候都能学习。所以，学会在低谷时期专注于学习，并且告诉自己艰难的日子终将过去，这是很重要的能力。过程和结果一样重要，因为过程最能塑造你。过程越深刻，收获越丰富。记住，你将会获得巨大的收获。
