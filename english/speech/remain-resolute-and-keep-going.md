# Remain Resolute And Keep Going

You've probably heard this before that tough times don't last forever but tough people do. That held true when you first heard it and it still holds true today. There will come a time in your life where you may cry and feel like your soul is dying. Those days when you struggle, want to give up, and don't want to face the world. These are the days that define you. Don't quit.

你可能听说过，艰难的时期总会过去，坚强的人才能笑到最后。这个道理，古今通用。在人生中，你可能会遇到艰难时期。你哭泣，你感到自己的灵魂正在死去。这种时候，你痛苦地挣扎，你想放弃，你不想面对这个世界。然而，这正是磨炼你的时候。不要放弃。

Difficulties come to make you strong, but that's only when you make a decision to go on, and you stand by it. Abraham Lincoln said, I'm not concerned that you have fallen and concerned that you will rise. Giving up as human nature brought about by fear, fear of, what if I fail and try, and then fail again. Wouldn't it just be easier to just quit? But here is what is wrong with that. When you give in to that fear, you sentence yourself to a lifetime of failure, a lifetime of regret, a situation where you lose faith in yourself and in humanity. Don't do that to yourself. 

只有在你下定决定要坚持到底的时候，困难才能让你更加强大。亚伯拉罕·林肯曾经说过，我不在乎你有没有跌倒，我在乎的是你有没有站起来。放弃是人类的天性，它是由恐惧引起的。要是我失败之后再次尝试，又失败了，怎么办？直接放弃，这不是更简单吗？但是，这种想法是不对的。当你向恐惧低头的时候，你注定了一生都要失败，一生都要后悔，你会对自己失去信心，对人性失去信心。不要这样对待自己。

You must understand that difficult times will come. There's absolutely nothing you can do about that. What you can do, however, is decide what you're going to do with the times. Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it, so you must decide to make a commitment to face it and deal with it, because at the end of pain is success. 

你必须明白，艰难时期总是会来的，你无法阻止它。然而，你能做的，就是决定自己要如何面对艰难时期。生活中，重要的不是发生了什么，而是你如何应对。所以，你必须决定好，下定决心去面对困难，处理困难，因为，痛苦的尽头，就是成功。

Name what it is that is holding you back. It may be fear. It may be procrastination, a relationship, self-doubt, or even depression. Whatever it is, identify it. You know you can, if you think deeply about it. Now write it down. This will put into perspective what you have to deal with. The big picture of your life will begin to become clear when you start paying attention to the tiniest details. Start with identifying what is holding you back. 

找出到底是什么东西拖了你的后腿，可能是恐惧，可能是拖延，可能是一段关系，可能是系我怀疑，甚至可能是抑郁。无论它是什么，首先要找到它。如果你认真思考，你就能找到它。然后，把这个东西写下来。这会让你清楚地看到，你到底要处理什么。当你开始注意人生中最小的细节时，你人生的大局就会变得清晰起来。找到拖你后腿的东西，从这一步做起。

Next, you have to let go of your anger and hate from the past. This is to help you heal yourself. You cannot be happy and productive if you hold on to old hurts. Let go of relationships and situations that are out of your control. Don't try to force it. You'll only end up hurting yourself some more. Your mental health is important, as it guides every other aspect of your life, your physical life, your spiritual life. They all become better when you maintain a healthy mental state. Let go of your past hurt.

接下来，你要放下过去的愤怒和怨恨，这能帮助你治愈自己。如果你总是沉溺于过去的伤痛，那么你不可能快乐，也不可能有所成就。放下那些你无法控制的人际关系和情况，不要勉强了。如果你放不下，你只会进一步伤害自己。你的心理健康是很重要的，因为它引导着你生活的每一个方面，你的生理健康，你的精神生活。如果你能保持健康的心理状态，你生活的方方面面都会变得更好。放下过去的伤痛吧。
