# You Don't Know How Strong You Are

Tough times separate those who give up and those who keep going. Tough times show what heart is really inside. Tough times show what courage is really inside. It's in our toughest moments that we see who people really are. Who are you? "You don't know how strong you are, until being strong is your only choice." Bob Marley said this. And it is so true! You don't even know how strong you are! You have inside you something so great, something so deep, something so strong. Do find that strength inside you.

艰难的岁月把轻易言弃的人和奋勇向前的人区分开来。困苦的时刻揭露了人的内心，展现了人的勇气。正是在最艰苦的时候，我们才能看清世人。你是谁？在坚强是你唯一的选择时，你才知道自己有多坚强。这是Bod Marley说的，说得对极了！你甚至根本不知道自己到底有多强大！在你的内心深处，你拥有很伟大、很深刻、很坚强的品质。你一定要找到这内在的力量。

Whatever you are going through, you can get through it. You will get through it, and it will make you stronger. It will make you wiser and it will make you better. That is what mentally tough people do. They do not allow anything to break them. They force hard times to make them. They learn lessons. They see the blessings. And most importantly they keep going. What lessons can you learn? What blessings can you take from this? If you asked me what is the most important thing one can do in overcoming anything. In one word I will give it to you. Purpose.

无论你正在经历什么，你都能渡过难关。你会战胜困难，而且这会使你更加坚强。它会使你更睿智、更优秀。内心强大的人会怎么做？他们不会让任何事打败自己，他们用困难来塑造自己，他们吸取经验，他们看见了困难中那宝贵的财富。最重要的是，他们永不放弃。你学到了什么经验？你从中得到了什么样的收获？如果你问我，对于一个人而言，要克服困难，最重要是什么？我只会告诉你一个词：目标。

If you know your purpose, if you know why you do what you do, if you know why you must fight, then you will fight. You will fight for your purpose. You will fight for your love. You will fight for that one person. You will fight for your family, for your friends. You will fight for your legacy. You will fight because you know you don't want future generations to give up, because you did. You want them to keep going because you did. You want them to say I will fight because I saw you fight. I will stay strong because you stood strong. That is mental toughness!

如果你知道自己的目标，如果你知道你为什么做你所做的事，如果你知道自己为什么必须奋斗，那么，你就会去奋斗。你会为了你的目标而奋斗，为了你的朋友而奋斗，为了你的财富而奋斗。你会奋斗，因为你明白，你不想因为自己的放弃而使得后人做事也半途而废。你想让他们不断进取，因为你做到了。你想让他们说，我会奋斗，因为我看见了你的奋斗；我会保持坚强，因为我看见了你的坚强。这就是精神的强大！
