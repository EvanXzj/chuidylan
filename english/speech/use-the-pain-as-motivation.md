# Use the PAIN as motivation

**You will come into obstacles. You probably already have, whether it's procrastination, friendship problems, family problems, money problems. Whatever it is, it's not going to be easy.** 

你会遇到阻碍。可能你已经遇到了，比如拖延症，友情问题，家庭问题，经济问题。无论这阻碍是什么，它都很难突破。

**A pain is just a byproduct. If you haven't experienced pain, then you will not have the motivation to become the best version of yourself. The pain is what will fuel you.** 

痛苦只是一个副作用而已。如果你没有经历过痛苦，那么你就没有动力去成为最好的自己。痛苦，会让你充满斗志。

**The most successful people on the planet have had to overcome catastrophic obstacles, and they came out on the other side stronger and wiser.** 

在这个世界上，最成功的人，都经历了巨大的痛苦，他们成功度过了难关，变得更加强大，更加睿智。

**Bill Gates's first business failed miserably. Albert Einstein didn't speak until he was four years old. Oprah Winfrey gave birth at 14 years old to a baby boy who died shortly afterwards. Thomas Edison failed 1,000 times before creating the light bulb. Franklin Roosevelt became partially paralyzed at the age of 39 for the rest of his life. He went on to lead the United States as one of the most respected presidents in history.** 

比尔盖茨，他最初做的生意，以惨痛失败告终。爱因斯坦，他直到四岁才学会说话。欧普拉温弗莉，她在十四岁的时候生了一个男婴，但孩子没多久就夭折了。爱迪生，他失败了一千次，才发明出灯泡。富兰克林罗斯福，他在39岁的时候遭遇了部分瘫痪，余生都如此，但他仍然坚持领导美国，他是历史上最受尊敬的总统之一。

**So it's not only you that is facing obstacles. It happens to everyone. But how do you deal with them is what will set you apart from everyone else. And as they say after the rain comes the rainbow. There are two sides of pain that a lot of people don't really understand. There's a side of pain than most people can relate to, the difficult side, the uncomfortable side. You always remember what that feels like.** 

所以，面临困难的，不只有你，大家都一样。但是，你处理困难的方式，会让你与众不同。正如人们说的，风雨后才有彩虹。很多人不明白，痛苦，也是有两面性的。大多数人知道痛苦的其中一面，也就是困难的一面，令人不适的一面，你永远都会记得这种感觉。

**But then there's the other side of pain. It's called effort. It's called winning. It's called if you can push through the suffering, there's some great things waiting for you on the other side. But you don't get to see them if you give up right now, and that's why a lot of people don't get to see this side of pain, because they give up before they get there.** 

但是，痛苦还有另一面，它是努力，是胜利。它意味着，如果你能熬过难关，你会收获很大的惊喜。但是，如果你现在就放弃了，你就无法看到这一切，所以，很多人没见过痛苦的这一面，因为他们半途而废了。

**It's not easy to continue studying when every part of your body is telling you to give up. It's so easy to give up. But it's at this point you need to give it everything you've got. It's about pushing yourself to the point where you feel out of your comfort zone. Because it's outside your comfort zone where the growth happens.** 

当你的身体想让你放弃时还坚持学习，这是很困难的。放弃是很容易的，但是，到了这个时候，你应该放手一搏。你要敦促自己，直到你走出舒适区为止。因为，只有走出舒适区，你才能成长。

**No one has become successful while staying within their comfort zone, absolutely no one. The first three seconds that you start studying, that's the hardest part. But if you can push through that, if you can push through the first few seconds of studying, it gets a lot easier. You realize it was the thought of studying that you were more bothered about than the actual studying itself.** 

获得成功的人，都是走出舒适区的人，没有人能够在舒适区里取得成功。你刚开始学习的那几秒钟，是最困难的。但是，如果你能熬过去，如果你能熬过刚开始学习的那几秒钟，事情就会变得容易很多。你会意识到，真正学起来，并没有那么困难。真正让你心烦的，是要去学习这种想法而已。

**It's never as bad as you thought it would be. You've got to stop complaining. You've got to stop the negativity. Complaining has zero benefits. It doesn't help anything. It just pulls others down with you. You've got to take action in your life. What are you doing about it? You've got to find a solution to your problem. Don't be the problem.** 

事情没你想的那么糟糕，你必须停止抱怨，你必须停止消极。抱怨对你没有好处，它不会起任何作用，它只会拖你的后腿，也拖了别人的后腿。你必须行动起来。你现在有采取什么行动吗？你必须找到解决问题的方法，不要让自己成为问题本身。

**I see it so many times where someone is getting bad grades but they blame everyone else but themselves. Believe me, that person is going nowhere. Nothing's going to happen in their life. And if that's you, if you're the person that is blaming everyone else for the situation they're in and not taking action for their own responsibilities, then this is for you.** 

有的人，他们没能取得好成绩，责怪所有人，却不反思自己。这样的情况，我已经见过太多了。相信我，这种人什么都做不成，好事不会发生在他们身上。如果你就是这种人，如果你不满意现状却要埋怨他人，如果你不愿意行动起来，为自己负责，那么，这个演讲，就是讲给你听的。

**Take action. Take control. If you keep studying at your full potential, and if you keep reading and keep learning and keep asking questions, you'll see the results for yourself. You'll see your grades increase significantly.**

采取行动，掌握自己的人生。如果你用尽全力去坚持学习，如果你坚持阅读，坚持学习，坚持提问，那么，你也会看见这带来的结果。你会看见，你的成绩有明显的提升。
