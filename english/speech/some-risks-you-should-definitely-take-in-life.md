# Some Risks you should definitely take in life

Risks are a part of all our lives. Some you take, some you don't. Actually, any decision you make has an element of risk. Nothing comes with a full warranty. Whenever you attempt to do anything, failure is a possibility. However, there are certain risks worth taking that can contribute significantly to your happiness. So, here are some risks you should definitely take in life!

风险，是人生的一部分。有些风险是你会去承担的，有些则不然。实际上，你做的每个决定，都包含了风险，没有什么事情是保证万无一失的。每当你尝试做一件事，你都可能会失败。然而，有些风险是值得你去承担的，它们能让你变得更快乐。那么，接下来将要介绍给你的，就是一些人生中你应该承担的风险。

Number 1 - Pursuing Your Dreams. Sure, many people have followed their dreams with passion, only to experience complete failure. What's even more tragic, however, is that most people never risk really pursuing their dreams. Everyone should make a serious attempt to realize their dreams at least once in life. After all, you don't want to find yourself sitting somewhere, old and decrepit, and have to ask yourself. What if I had done it? What kind of life could I have had?

第一，追寻你的梦想。确实，很多人满怀热情地追寻梦想，到头来却彻底失败了。然而，更悲哀的是，有些人从来不敢追求自己的梦想。在人生中，每个人都应该认真地尝试实现自己的梦想，至少要有一次这样的经历。毕竟，你可不想在白发苍苍时才回头问自己，如果当初我实现了梦想呢？我的人生会是什么样的？

Number 2 - Risk Rejection. The reason we get rejected usually has much more to do with the person who turned us down than with us. Regardless of what's at stake – whether you ask someone out on a date or just want a bit of advice – there will be some people that just won't comply with your wishes. The fear of rejection is what keeps many people from asking for what they want. It often seems better not to ask at all than risk a no. Yet, if you don't even ask, how can you expect to get a yes.

第二，承担被拒绝的风险。我们被拒绝，更多地是因为拒绝我们那个人，而不是因为我们自己有问题。不管是什么事，比如你想与某人约会，或者想得到一点建议，总会有人不如你愿。很多人不敢去索要自己想要的东西，因为他们害怕被拒绝。貌似，与其被拒绝，还不如不要开口问。然而，如果你连问都不敢问，那你就别指望人家答应你了。

Number 3 - Experiencing Something New. When you learn or try something new, there's always an element of risk. Skiing, sky-diving - even learning how to skate - can be pretty intimidating. There is a real chance you can injure yourself. But you feel so great when you conquer your fears! It's the same when you risk a big change in your life. Quitting your job and moving abroad or pursuing a new career takes some guts. But if that really appeals to you, you just have to risk it - or risk remaining unsatisfied with your life!

第三，尝试新事物。当你学习或者尝试新事物的时候，总是会有一定的风险的。滑雪，跳伞，甚至是学溜冰，这些看起来都挺吓人的。确实，你可能真的会伤到自己。但是，当你克服了恐惧之后，你会有很棒的感受！同理，在人生中，你冒险去做出改变的话也是如此。辞职，移民，追求新的事业，这些都需要勇气。但是，如果这就是你想要的，你就必须冒险，不然你这辈子都不会对自己的人生感到满意！

Number 4 - Risk Missing Out on Something. People don't like missing out on fun events or pleasant pastimes. Sitting in your favorite bar and chatting with friends every night or going on that vacation holiday can be very tempting. Devoting ourselves to our health, work and success makes it seems like we might be missing out. Business before pleasure can be uninspiring. But think about it for a moment: how many parties, concerts and beach holidays have really made a difference in your life? What could you achieve if you were willing to miss out on something, now and then?

第四，承担错过一些东西的风险。人们不希望错过好玩的事情，或者令人快乐的消遣时光。每晚都坐在最爱的酒吧里跟朋友聊天，或者去度假，这些都很令人心动。花时间去管理我们的健康，努力工作，追求成功，这可能会让我们错过一些东西。先苦后甜，这是并不是什么鼓舞人心的事。但是，想一想，有多少派对，音乐会，在海边度过的假日，能够让你的人生有所不同？如果你愿意偶尔错过一些东西，最后你会取得什么样的成就？

Number 5 - Risk Saying I Love You First. Being the first to say I love you to someone can frighten the bravest of us. It's because it makes you extremely vulnerable emotionally. And, if your partner doesn't say, I love you too, you will feel what seems like the ultimate rejection. Yet, that person could say those words you want to hear! If you feel that way, he or she very likely does as well - but they just may be more afraid of saying it than you are. And if they don't respond as you hope, at least you know where you stand and can reevaluate your relationship.

第五，冒险去当那个先表白的人。主动说我爱你，这可能是大多数人都不敢做的事，因为这让你在情感上显得很脆弱。而且，如果对方没有回应说我也爱你，你会觉得人家就是完全拒绝你了。然而，对方有可能会说出你想要的回答！如果你有那样的感受，那么对方可能也会有一样的感受，只是人家比你更害怕把那句话说出来而已。如果他们给的回答不如你愿，起码你能知道目前的情况如何，你也能重新审视你们的关系。

Number 6 - Expressing Your Opinion. Everyone has their own opinion on just about anything. Expressing your own point of view might seem risky. You don't know how it will be received. You might really upset someone. You might even find out that your opinion is demonstrably wrong! A lot of people prefer to avoid potential conflict or contradiction - and they don't speak up for themselves. Yet, if you don't say what you think – at least some of the time – others will think that you have nothing to offer or have no principles - or even lack intelligence. Interesting people express their opinions, even if they are sometimes unpopular. They are often successful people, because they have as little fear of failure as they have in saying what they think.

第六，表达你的观点。对于每一件事，每个人都有自己的观点。表达自己的观点，貌似这也是有风险的，因为你不知道自己的观点会得到什么样的回应，可能你会让某个人不开心，可能你甚至会发现自己的观点明显是错误的！很多人希望避免潜在的冲突，所以他们不表达自己的观点。然而，如果你从来都不表达自己的观点，那么别人可能会认为你没有什么想法，或者认为你没有原则，甚至认为你不够聪明。那些有趣的人，就算他们的观点可能不太受欢迎，他们也会表达自己的观点。这些人往往是成功人士，因为他们不害怕失败，所以也不害怕说出自己的想法。

Number 7 - Risk Losing Friends. Friends are important. Life without them would be very dissatisfying. But they can also get in the way of your dreams. When you are pursuing your goals, you will often need to spend a lot of time by yourself. And friends can make it difficult for you to concentrate and remain focused. Some friends will even try to get you to give it all up because they are feeling left out. True friends will take your dreams seriously and understand that you need to take some time away from them. They will work on preserving their friendship with you, even if they don't see you as often as they would like.

第七，承担失去朋友的风险。朋友是很重要的，没有朋友的人生是难以令人满意的。但是，朋友也可能成为你逐梦路上的绊脚石。当你追逐梦想时，你需要独自度过很多时间，朋友会让你难以专注。有些朋友甚至会尝试让你放弃梦想，因为他们觉得自己被抛弃了。真正的朋友会认真对待你的梦想，他们理解你，能够接受你和他们待在一起的时间变少。就算和你见面的次数比他们期待的少，他们也会努力维持这段友谊。

Number 8 - Risk Inadequacy. Sometimes you will not be good enough. Sometimes you won't have what it takes. But isn't it better to find that out for yourself than having to ask yourself if, maybe, you could have become a great musician or a sports star? Sometimes you have the talent or skills, and sometimes you don't. You might become obsessed with a certain "what if" your entire life. But if you knew you could have never made it, you won't be haunted by useless regrets. You will never know unless you give it your best try and risk not being good enough.

第八，冒险去做一个有缺陷的人。有时候，你就是不够优秀，你就是没有足够的能力。如果我能成为一个伟大的音乐家或者足球明星会怎样？你这样质问自己，还不如自己去发现你还不够优秀或能力不够的事实，对吧？或许，你这一辈子都会纠结某些可能做到的事，但是，如果你明确知道自己永远做不到，你就不会一直后悔，这种后悔是没有意义的。只有当你真的全力以赴了，并且冒险去做一个不够优秀的人，你才会看清真相，才会明白这个道理。
